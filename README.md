## Class seating planner

When I was in Sainte Genevieve school, I made this little algorithm to generate the best "seating plan".

Actually, we had to make a seating plan called "serpentin".
It is just a grid with numbers. Every student has a number and everyday, we increment the number by one. The goal is to make a good seat rotation.
I don't know if I made it the good way because it is a bit naive but it works well.

Note: There are reserved seats for certain students called "5/2", their number is "-1" and they don't have to change their seats.
